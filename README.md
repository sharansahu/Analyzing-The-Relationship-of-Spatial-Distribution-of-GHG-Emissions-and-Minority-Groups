# Analyzing-The-Relationship-of-Spatial-Distribution-of-GHG-Emissions-and-Minority-Groups

Global climate change seems to impact marginalized populations the most even though they have contributed to climate change the least. Furthermore, in documentaries such as Fence Line, we have seen how oil and power companies are located near marginalized communities, thus creating disparities in terms of climate change effects on these groups. By using environmental data science, a subset of data science concerned with using data analysis on environmental data sets to come to environmental conclusions, this creative project seeks to use demographic datasets and datasets from the Environmental Protection Agency regarding greenhouse gas reporting to visualize the relationship between the spatial distribution of marginalized groups and GHG Emissions. This will use technologies such as Python, various data science packages to create visualizations, and machine learning forecasting models such as ARIMA to illustrate a time series of how GHG emissions are predicted to increase along with predicted increase marginalized groups. This project also seeks to create insights that we have not discussed in class such as the relationship between the spatial distribution of GHG emissions and other minority groups that we have not investigated thoroughly, though it is mainly centered around Hispanics.
